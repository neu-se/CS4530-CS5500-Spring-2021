Reflections on the CRC assignment

1.  Should make collaborators just the depends-on relation (not its
symmetric closure).  The symmetric closure adds no information, and in
fact loses information (who depends on who?)

2. We went astray by adding State to the list of things to go on the
CRC card.  State is really part of responsibilities, as in:

"Resonsibility: counts the number of ticks it receives"
or
"Responsibility: maintains the map from alarms to their locations"

This also solves^H^H^H avoids  the problem of whether interfaces have state.

IClock's Responsibility:  Defines the interface for classes that count
count the number of ticks they receive.
