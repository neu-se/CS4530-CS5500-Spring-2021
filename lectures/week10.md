### Learning Objectives:

In this week of the course, you will learn to:
* Relate continuous development to classic software process models (waterfall and agile)
* Identify the stages of a continuous development pipeline and describe how they relate to improving code velocity and quality 
* Describe the difference between key deployment container abstractions and their role in modern software
* Describe the distinction between a DevOps and “traditional” developer/operator mentality
