# Activity: Interpreting UML 

The goal of this activity is to have the students think about the subtleties of how a UML diagram represents the real world, and how those subtleties might be reflected in code

Consider the Car-has-Wheels example in Lesson 2.2.   What navigability should the "has" association be given?   Should you be able to get from Car to Wheel?  From Wheel to Car?
In your answer, consider what an object of class Car represents in the real world, and what an object of class Wheel represents in the real world.  How should this association be represented in code?

We will go into breakout rooms in groups of 4 for 20 minutes.  At the end of that time, we will reassemble and I will call on people to report on what their group decided.  I may call on anyone, so everyone in your group should be prepared to report.
