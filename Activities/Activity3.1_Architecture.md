# Activity 3.1: Talking about software architectures

Discuss the following question: of the software architectures discussed in Lesson 3.1, which best describes the design of covey.town?  You may decide that more than one architecture applies, reflecting different views of the system.

Next, consider the varies illities listed in Lesson 3.1. How does the architectural design of covey.town influence these characteristics?  You needn't consider all those characteristics; rather, you should choose a few of them where you think there's an important impact.

We will go into breakout rooms in groups of 4 for 20 minutes.  At the end of that time, we will reassemble and I will call on people to report on what their group decided.  I may call on anyone, so everyone in your group should be prepared to report.
