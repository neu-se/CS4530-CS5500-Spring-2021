# Project Showcase
Students in CS4530 and CS5500 proposed, designed, and implemented new features for [Covey.Town](https://github.com/neu-se/covey.town), which provides a virtual meeting space where different groups of people can have simultaneous video calls, allowing participants to drift between different conversations, just like in real life. 

Many of these projects can be found [as forks on GitHub](https://github.com/neu-se/covey.town/network/members), and some students have volunteered to have their projects publicly listed in this showcase:
